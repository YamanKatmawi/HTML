        Aleppo is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world;
        it may have been inhabited since the 6th millennium BC.</strong
      >
      <small>[10] Excavations at Tell as-Sawda and Tell al-Ansari, </small> just
      south of the old city of Aleppo, show that the area was occupied by
      Amorites by the latter part of the 3rd millennium BC. [11] That is also
      the time at which Aleppo is first mentioned in cuneiform tablets unearthed
      in Ebla and Mesopotamia, which speak of it as part of the Amorite state of
      Yamhad,
      <mark>
        and note its commercial and military proficiency. [12] Such a long
        history is attributed to its strategic location as a trading center
        midway between the Mediterranean</mark
      >
      Sea and Mesopotamia.
      Modern-day English-speakers commonly refer to the city as Aleppo. 
      It was known in antiquity as Khalpe, Khalibon, 
      and to the Greeks and Romans as Beroea (Βέροια).[20] During the Crusades,
       and again during the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon of 1923–1946,
        the name Alep was used. Aleppo represents the Italianised version of this.
